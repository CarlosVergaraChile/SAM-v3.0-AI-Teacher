- **Contingency:** Reduce teacher target, extend pilot 2 weeks

**Risk 2: LMS Integration Issues**
- **Indicator:** >2% assignment import failures, >10% grade sync errors
- **Mitigation:** Dedicated integration engineer, custom adapters
- **Contingency:** Manual workarounds, use API instead of LMS connectors

**Risk 3: Product Stability Issues**
- **Indicator:** >0.5% uptime SLA miss, >5 critical bugs in 2 weeks
- **Mitigation:** Pre-pilot testing, daily monitoring, hotfix process
- **Contingency:** Scale down pilot scope, focus on stable features

**Risk 4: Customer Churning**
- **Indicator:** Customer considering exit before Week 14
- **Mitigation:** Executive intervention, customization, pricing adjustment
- **Contingency:** Convert to reference customer (ongoing support), gather learnings

## Pilot Expansion & Transition to Phase 4
