## BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS

### Monthly Break-Even

```
Fixed Costs (monthly): $674K / 12 = $56,200

Enterprise Model:
├─ Per-deal contribution: $750K deal - $105K costs = $645K
├─ Deals needed monthly: $56.2K / $645K = 0.087 deals/month
├─ Translation: 1 deal per 11 months
├─ Timeline to profitability: 6 months (with pilot + 2 enterprise deals)

SaaS Model:
├─ Monthly contribution per user: $10/12 = $0.83
├─ Users needed: $56.2K / $0.83 = 67,700 users
├─ Timeline: 18-24 months (requires significant marketing)
```

### CAC Payback Period

```
CAC: $60,000 per enterprise deal
Monthly Contribution: $750K deal / 36 months = $20,833/month
Payback Period: $60K / $20.8K = 2.9 months

Conclusion: CAC is recovered in 3 months (highly favorable)
```

## KEY ASSUMPTIONS

### Conservative Estimates

✅ **CAC of $60K** - Industry average for enterprise education is $50-80K
✅ **Onboarding $45K** - Includes 2-3 week integration with legacy LMS
✅ **3 enterprise deals Year 1** - Realistic given 6-9 month sales cycle
✅ **$750K average deal** - Conservative for universities with 5K-20K users
✅ **Fallback cluster $180K** - Required for regulatory compliance (DeepSeek geopolitical risk)

### Risk Scenarios

⚠️ **Worst Case** (50% chance):
- Only 1-2 enterprise deals Year 1 = $500K-$1M revenue
- SaaS adoption slower than forecast
- Result: Break-even by Month 10

🟢 **Best Case** (30% chance):
- 4-5 enterprise deals = $2M+ revenue
- SaaS accelerates to 100K users
- Result: $1M+ net profit Year 1

⚡ **Base Case** (assumed above - 20% chance):
- 3 enterprise deals + pilot
- SaaS grows to 50K users
- Result: $826K net profit

## FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

### Cash Burn Rate

```
Monthly Burn: $674K / 12 = $56.2K
Annual Runway: $674K (with zero revenue)

With Revenue:
├─ Month 1-3: Burn $56.2K × 3 = $169K (pilot prep)
├─ Month 4-6: Burn $56.2K × 2 = $112K (1 deal closes)
├─ Month 7-12: Profit phase (2 more deals + pilot)
└─ Total Year 1 burn: $281K

Required Funding: $350K (covers burn + contingency)
```

### Use of Funds

```
Year 1 Allocation ($674K):
├─ Personnel & Operations: $324K (48%)
├─ Llama 3 Fallback Cluster: $180K (27%)
├─ Sales & Marketing (CAC): $110K (16%)
├─ Implementation & Onboarding: $45K (7%)
└─ Insurance & Compliance: $15K (2%)
```
